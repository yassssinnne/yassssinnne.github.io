										<p>This module teaches students the basics of JavaScript and introduces them to the Processing JS package, which allows them to create drawings and animations. JavaScript is a commonly used language that may be used in conjunction with HTML to create webpages or for libraries such as p5.js. As a result, laying a firm foundation in this language was important, and this module made that feasible. For me, the most important takeaway from this session was learning about variables, functions, logic and if statements, loops, arrays, objects, and object-oriented design, since I now apply these ideas on a regular basis when coding.</p>

										<p>This module provides students with an overview to HTML/CSS, allowing them to develop and design their own websites. It gives students with a solid foundation that can be built upon with the aid of online projects and other resources. In my instance, I proceeded to learn more about web pages by watching instructive Khan Academy videos and visiting sites like Github. As the world moves toward a digital future, there is a lot that can be done with site design. </p>

										<p>This module looked at some advanced JavaScript for games and visualisations. Create applications with several scenes, 3D graphics, button menus, and games with scores were among the subjects taught. This module offers a basic introduction to game programming and graphics, since it extends on JavaScript's applications. As a result, I may continue studying in the future by investigating sophisticated games and visualisations and building them by delving further into 3D visuals, employing more complex game structures, desktop editors, and debugging tools. For me, the most important aspect of this subject was learning about buttons and transforms. My understanding of buttons enabled me to increase user involvement in a variety of programmes, including several of my webpages. </p>

										<p>This module, like Games & Visualizations, built on the students' current JavaScript skills. It's an intriguing unit that blends JS, Processing JS, physics, and mathematical principles to show how the disciplines are related. The course focuses on using oscillations, trigonometry, angular movement, forces, vectors, noise, and randomness to imitate natural trends observable in nature. The substantial emphasis on object-oriented programming was the most important component of this module for me since it helped me to become comfortable with the design, which will be essential when employing complicated data in my projects. </p>

										</header>
										<p>For our Hackathon, my team and I decided to make a calculator, our calculator was a massive win for us as we did not expect it to fully function and we faced many issues on the way, overall this project made me realize team work is essential in computer science because each individual has some strengths and weaknesses and if you work together as a group you overcome them surprisingly fast.</p>

										<p>Flappy Bird on the other hand, enabled the creative side of us and helped us grasp and understand JavaScript even better than we used to, we made what was a plain black & white boring game to a retro vibe game and we updated many things such as levels, interaction with user, design, etc.</p>

										</header>
										<p>This module required us to recreate one of Professor Daniel Shiffman's Coding sessions as well as follow along and rework the coding sessions of our classmates. Because we could use these tools to simply add our creative refactors while rebuilding the projects, this project helped students to become more comfortable with object-oriented programming. It actually challenges pupils to think outside the box and solve problems. To continue learning, I can do more of Professor Shiffman's Coding Challenges on my own time, as they cover a range of important JavaScript skills. For me, the most important aspect of this challenge was being able to improve my understanding of object-oriented programming and practise debugging since I encountered several problems along the route.</p>
