										<p>This module teaches students the basics of JavaScript and introduces them to the Processing JS package, which allows them to create drawings and animations. JavaScript is a commonly used language that may be used in conjunction with HTML to create webpages or for libraries such as p5.js. As a result, laying a firm foundation in this language was important, and this module made that feasible. For me, the most important takeaway from this session was learning about variables, functions, logic and if statements, loops, arrays, objects, and object-oriented design, since I now apply these ideas on a regular basis when coding.</p>

										<p>This module allows students to gain an introduction to HTML and CSS in order to create and design their own websites. It provides them with a good basis that can be further developed with the help of the projects and other resources found on the web. In my case I continued to develop my knowledge with web pages through educational YouTube videos and other sites such as FreeCodeCamp. There is truly so much that can be done with web design as the world is progressing into a digital era. The most impactful portion of this module for me was learning about CSS selectors such as classes which allowed me to create more complex websites while being able to stay organized and efficient while using multiple class selectors. </p>

											<h2><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-natural-simulations">Khan Academy Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations</h2>

										<p>This module explored some advanced JavaScript in the sense of games and visualizations. Some of the topics covered included create programs with multiple scenes, 3D graphics, button menus and games with scores. As this module expands on the applications of JavaScript it is a mere introduction to game development and graphics. Therefore, for the future I could continue learning by looking into complicated games and visualizations and creating them by diving deeper into 3D graphics, using more complex game structures, desktop editors and debugging tools. The most significant portion of this module for me, was learning about buttons and transformations. My knowledge on buttons allowed me to get more user interaction within multiple different programs such as in some of my webpages. Meanwhile, transformations allowed for easy manipulation of shapes in my programs and turned out to be an essential tool to use in natural simulations. </p>

										<p>This module once again like Games & Visualizations, expanded on the students’ existing knowledge of JavaScript. It is an interesting unit which combines JS, Processing JS, physics and mathematical concepts, allowing you to see how the subjects tie together. The course focused on imitating the natural tendencies seen in nature through the use of oscillations, trigonometry, angular movement, forces, vectors noise and randomness. I can continue my learning in Natural Simulations by reading “The Nature of Code" by Daniel Shiffman, to learn how to simulate more of nature’s tendencies and to make more connections with math and physics. The most significant part of this module for me, was the heavy emphasis on object-oriented programming as it allowed me to get familiar with the design as it will become more useful when using complex data for my programs. </p>

										<p>This module involved recreating one of Professor Daniel Shiffman’s Coding as well as following along and refactoring our classmates’ coding sessions. This project allowed students to get more familiar with object-oriented programming as we could use these tools to easily add our creative refactors when remaking the projects. It truly forces students to problem solve and code thinking out of the box. To continue to learn, on my own time I can follow more of Professor Shiffman’s Coding Challenges as they cover a variety of essential JavaScript techniques. The most significant part of this challenge for me, was being able to get more familiarized with object-oriented programming and to be able to practice debugging as I ran into many errors along the way.</p>
