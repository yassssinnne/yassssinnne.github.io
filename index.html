  <h4>Online Data Security and Introduction to CyberSecurity are both my favorites because I will be taking this course in university as a computer science major,
    my favorite aspects of this module is that it enhanced my understanding of cybersecurity. What's for Dinner, Animal Attack, Fish Tank, Paint Splatter, Snake, 
    and Make it Rain helped introduce me to many concepts in javascript and really helped me understand it a lot, and as a computer science major I will probably
    use JavaScript for my first year in universtiy, and as I mentioned my favorite aspects of these modules is that they expanded my knowledge within JavaScript.
    Recipe Book and Event Invite on the other hand helped me understand the concepts of HTML/CSS.</h4>
